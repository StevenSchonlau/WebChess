# WebChess

This was a brief summer project I did as a rising sophomore that I believed turned out quite well. I used p5JS and a little bit of HTML/CSS to create WebChess, which is currently playable on my [website](https://www.stevenschonlau.com). The hardest parts were making sure that you couldn't move the king into check, castling, and weird pawn rules like en passante and promotion.

If I could do it again, I think that I would create more efficient/modularized array checking functions that would take out a lot of the repetition present in the current code.
